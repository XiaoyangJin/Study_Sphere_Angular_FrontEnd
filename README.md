# Study Sphere Angular FrontEnd

## Overview
Welcome to the `Study_Sphere_Angular_FrontEnd` repository! This repository contains the frontend code for the Study Sphere website, an interactive platform designed using Angular. The frontend interacts with a PostgreSQL database through a Spring Boot API, with the backend code available in a separate repository: [Study Sphere Spring Backend](https://github.com/XiaoyangJin/Study_Sphere_Spring_BackEnd).

## Features
- **Web Page Design**: Utilizes HTML and CSS to create an engaging and responsive user interface.
- **Interactive User Experience**: Leverages TypeScript to add dynamic reactions and interactive elements.
- **Angular Framework**: Built using the powerful Angular framework for a robust and scalable frontend architecture.
- **Integration with Backend**: Seamlessly communicates with the Spring Boot backend for data management and storage.
